# Discord API Ratelimiting.

A collection of ratelimiting solution for Discord's API. The structure is:
```
- language
  - github name
    - README.md
    - files needed for ratelimiting
```

## Using

You can use any code here for your projects. Do not bug the authors about how to change code for your needs or similar, going into this you're expected to have an intermediate knowledge of the language you're using. These are mainly to show logic. If you find an error in the code, you may either create an issue tagging the creator or a PR. If you create a PR fixing it, make sure to add yourself to the README.

## Contributing

Make a PR with a working ratelimiting solution and add the files specified above. The README should contain the following information:

- Explanation on usage
- A list of any depdendencies your solution uses, you should not be including any build file.
- Discord lib that uses it (if applicable and you would like to add it)
- Any additional contributors (if applicable)

All code should be properly documented and commented. Data classes are encouraged to be created but are not required, if you don't create them you should give a small example of how to make one that has 3 fields (aka a field that is nullable, a field that is optional, and a field that is neither) and how to de-serialize to it in the README.
